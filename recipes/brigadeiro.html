    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        Brigadeiro is a beloved Brazilian confection celebrated for its rich chocolate taste
        and velvety texture. Crafted by cooking sweetened condensed milk, cocoa powder,
        and butter until it thickens, each bite-sized treat is then rolled in chocolate sprinkles 
        for a satisfying crunch. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
        While traditionally served at birthday parties and special occasions, 
        brigadeiros can also be enjoyed as a quick indulgence any time. 
        Some variations introduce flavors like coconut, hazelnut, or even a touch of coffee, 
        ensuring there's always room for creativity. Whether you stick to the classic recipe
        or experiment with twists, these little chocolate truffles never fail to delight.
