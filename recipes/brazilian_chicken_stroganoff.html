    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a Brazilian adaptation of the famous Russian stroganoff recipe. It's very common and a part of everyday life in Brazil,  
        since it's easy to make and incredibly delicious. Usually, it is served with white rice, which will soak up the sauce,  
        and shoestring potatoes on top, to add a little bit of crunchiness to the dish. The combination of the creamy, flavorful sauce  
        with the crispy shoestring potatoes creates a unique contrast in texture that makes this dish so special.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a bunch of different ways to make this dish: some people like to add mushrooms and olives,  
        others prefer to use beef or shrimp instead of chicken, and some even add ketchup or mustard for a  
        different flavor. No matter how you make it, Brazilian Chicken Stroganoff is always a crowd-pleaser! 
        It's a go-to comfort food for many families and is often enjoyed at both casual dinners and special gatherings.
